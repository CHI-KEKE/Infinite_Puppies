# Infinite Scroll Prac

## Intro
This is a website demo I created based on the lectures of "JavaScript Web Projects" course from Zero To Mastery, as they mentioned in the end of the course,
I try to organize the code more understandable.<br><br>
The goal of the couse is to learn how to make an infinite scroll of a web page.
